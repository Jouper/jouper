		<![CDATA[<p>The Section Editor conducts the peer review for the submission, although some Sections of the journal may not use peer review (e.g., Book Reviews), and the Section Editor arrives at an editorial decision for the submission on the Review page.</p>]]>	
	</section>
	<section title="Review Version">
		<![CDATA[<p>The first task for the Section Editor with each submission is to check the text to whether the Original Version can serve as the Review Version or that a revised copy needs to be uploaded.  To view the Original File, the Section Editor clicks on the blue file name.</p><p><i>Ensuring a blind Peer Review</i>. For submissions undergoing a blind Peer Review, the Section Editor should check to see that all author identification has been removed from the file: (a) author's reference to their own work should use the convention of  "Author" plus year, and (b) the document's Properties should not include the author's name (with MS Word, look under the menu for File). The Section Editor should also consult the Submission page to check whether Supplementary Files can be shared with Reviewers. If the author felt the files could be presented to Reviewers, they will be checked (although the Section Editor can un-check them).</p><p><i>Establishing the submission's Review Version</i>. The Section Editor sets the Review Version  which Reviewers will see, by (a) selecting the Original Version, if it is suitable, or (b) by uploading a more suitable version. The Section Editor can choose to fix minor problems with the original file using a word processor to make the changes, saving the file to the desktop and then uploading the file, using the Browse/Upload buttons in Review Version.</p><p><i>Inadequately prepared submissions</i>. If the submission has clearly failed to adhere to the journal's Author Guidelines, including the need for a blind review, the Section Editor can elect to notify the author that the work needs to be resubmitted. The author can then resubmit the improved version directly to the editor by email, who can then upload it as the Review Version. The Section Editor can also decide that the submission is simply not suited for the journal and notify the author to that effect, while going to the Submission page and clicking "Archive Submission" sending to the Archives.</p>]]>

	<section title="Peer Review">
		<![CDATA[<p>Once the Review Version has been selected, the Section Editor can begin the Peer Review process. The Section Editor first clicks on the "Select Reviewer" button which directs the Section Editor to a list of Reviewers, along with their interests and work with the journal. The Section Editor then clicks "Assign" next to the names of the Reviewers that appear suitable for the assignment.</p><p><i>Changing Reviewers</i>. If the Section Editor realizes that a name chosen is not suitable, the "Clear Reviewer" button can be used to clear the Reviewer's name before initiating the review (once the Reviewer has been notified by email, this button changes to "Cancel Review"). To replace a Reviewer who has been notified, the Section Editor clicks "Cancel Review" which leads to a Cancel email to send to the existing Reviewer. The Section Editor then clicks Select Reviewer and assigns an another Reviewer, and sends out the Request email to that Reviewer. If a Section Editor cancels a review, and a Reviewer then responds that the review is done, the Section Editor can re-initiate the review by sending a Request email to the Reviewer. A list of the Reviewers who declined the request to review the submission or were cancelled is kept under "Regrets, Cancel, and Earlier Rounds of this Submission."</p><p><i>Requesting and initiating a Peer Review</i>. The Section Editor clicks on the email icon under Request for the Reviewer which opens a prepared email addressed to the Reviewer. The email can be revised before being sent it to the prospective Reviewer. After clicking Send, the Section Editor will also have a chance to change the number of weeks given for the review to be completed. The Journal Manager sets the default number of weeks in Setup 2.3. If a Reviewer has not responded to the request in a timely fashion, the Section Editor can send another request email by clicking on the email icon under Request a second time, or the Section Editor can opt to select another Reviewer.</p><p><i>The Reviewer responds on the Web site</i>. The Reviewer may respond to the invitation by visiting the journal Website and notifying the Section Editor by email that the review will or will not be undertaken as requested. If the Reviewer declines the request, their name goes to "Regrets, Cancel, and Earlier Rounds of this Submission" and the Section Editor selects another reviewer. If the Reviewer agrees to conduct the review, the date of the acceptance appears under Response for that Reviewer. The Journal Manager has the option in Setup XXXX of activating an automatic reminder to be sent to Reviewers who do not respond top the request within a certain number of days.</p><p><i>The Reviewer responds by email</i>. If instead of going to the journal's Web site, the Reviewer sends the Section Editor an email declining to do the review, the Section Editor goes to the Review page for the Submission and clicks the Cancel Review button associated with that reviewer. When the Cancel Review email appears, the Section can either cancel the email (so it will not be sent) or modify the wording of the email, along the lines of "...perhaps next time." This, too, will clear the Reviewer's name from the Peer Review stage (and place on the page with Regrets. Cancels and Earlier Rounds). The Section Editor can then select another Reviewer.</p><p><i>The Reviewer completes the review</i>. The Reviewer completes the review by entering their comments in Review (based on the Reviewer Guidelines which have been entered in Setup 2.2 by the Journal Manager) and selecting a Recommendation (from a pull-down menu: Accept, Accept with Revisions, Resubmit for Review, Resubmit Elsewhere, Decline, See Comments). The Reviewer may also opt to upload files, whether an annotated version of the submission or some additional relevant information, which the Section Editor will decide whether the author will see, using the "Author can view" option. The Journal Manager has the option in Setup 2.3 of activating an automatic email reminder to be sent to Reviewers who do not complete the review within a certain number of days of the deadline. The Section Editor can also send a reminder by using the email icon under Request for that Reviewer, and modifying the content to reflect the need for the review.</p>]]>

	<section title="Editor Decision">
		<![CDATA[<p>Once all the reviews are in, the Section Editor must arrive at a decision on the submission. To assist the Section Editor, the Reviewer's Reviews have been automatically placed in the Editor/Author Correspondence (except for those parts the Reviewers have identified as for the Section Editor alone). The Section Editor can edit these comments, which are identified by letter (e.g., Reviewer A, etc.). The Section Editor should outline the basis of their decision to the Author in Editor/Author Correspondence (as the Author cannot see the Decision recorded by the Editor). The Section Editor can save and edit these comments before emailing them to the author. Each time the Section Editor emails the Author only the current comments are sent, while the cumulative set of comments remain available to the Section Editor and the Author or their respective journal pages for the Review of this submission. The Section Editor can also upload a version of the submission possibly with suggestions or comments.</p><p><i>Recording the Decision</i>. The Section Editor selects a Decision from among Accept, Accept Pending Revisions, Resubmit for Review, or Decline. The Section Editor can make an initial decision, Accept Pending Revisions, and then after being satisfied by the Author Version uploaded by the Author, make a second decision to Accept. If the Section Editor selects Accept, then the next step is to designate a version of the submission to go to Copyediting on the Editing page, from among the Editor and Author versions. The default Editor Version is simply the Review Version, and the Section Editor can make changes to this version - restoring the author's name, for example - and upload it as an additional Editor Version, suitable to go to Copyediting. If the Section Editor selects Decline, the submission moves to the Archives list, with its status recorded as Declined.</p><p><i>Resubmit for Review</i>. The Section Editor can initiate a second round of reviews for a submission. The Section Editor records Resubmit for Review as the Decision, and notifies the Author of this (as the Author cannot see the Decision), while providing an outline of what needs to be done with the submission prior to resubmitting it for review. When the Author re-submits a version for review, it appears under Author Version, and the Section Editor designates it for resubmission. It then becomes the Review Version for Round 2 (and should again be checked for anonymity, and if need be, uploaded again under Review Version). The Reviewers from Round 1 will still be in place, although their reviews and recommendations will have been cleared and placed under "Regrets, Cancel, and Earlier Rounds of this Submission." The Section Editor can activate the request for each of the Reviewers from Round 1 by clicking on the email icon under Request, or the Section Editor can use Clear Reviewer and select another Reviewer for Round 2. The Editor/Author Correspondence for Round 1 is also placed under "Regrets, Cancel, and Earlier Rounds of this Submission," where the Section Editor can review it as needed.</p>]]>
